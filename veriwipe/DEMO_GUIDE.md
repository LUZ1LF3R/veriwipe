# VeriWipe Demo Guide: How It Works (For Beginners)

## üéØ **What is VeriWipe?**

Think of VeriWipe as a **"Digital Shredder"** that completely destroys data on old computers, phones, and USB drives so that **nobody can ever recover it**. It's like burning paper documents, but for digital data.

## ü§î **Why Do We Need This?**

**The Problem**: When you delete files or format a drive, the data isn't really gone - hackers can still recover it!

**The Solution**: VeriWipe uses military-grade techniques to **permanently destroy** all data, making recovery impossible.

## üé™ **Live Demonstration Walkthrough**

- Plug in the VeriWipe USB drive
- Restart computer and boot from USB
- A special Linux desktop appears with VeriWipe icon
```

**What's Happening**: The USB contains a complete operating system that runs WITHOUT installing anything on the computer. It's like having a portable computer repair shop on a USB stick!

### **Step 2: Launch VeriWipe** üöÄ

```
What You See:

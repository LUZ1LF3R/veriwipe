## 🎭 **Live Demonstration Script**

### **Phase 1: Hook & Problem Setup** (1 minute)

**You Say**:
> *"Before I show you our solution, let me demonstrate the problem. This laptop has sensitive data on it. Watch what happens when I 'delete' files..."*

**Actions**:
1. Show normal file deletion
2. Use data recovery tool to restore files
3. Say: *"See? Your deleted data isn't really gone. This is why people hoard old devices - fear of data breaches."*

### **Phase 2: VeriWipe Boot** (2 minutes)

**You Say**:
> *"Now let me show you VeriWipe. This USB drive contains our complete AI-powered solution. No installation needed - it runs from anywhere."*

**Actions**:
1. **Shutdown target system**
2. **Insert VeriWipe USB drive**
3. **Power on and press F12/F2** (boot menu key for your system)
4. **Select USB device** from boot menu
5. **Wait for Ubuntu desktop** to load (30-60 seconds)

**Commentary While Booting**:
> *"This is a complete Linux operating system running from USB. It's isolated from the host computer, so it can safely wipe drives without interference."*

### **Phase 3: Launch VeriWipe** (1 minute)

**You Say**:
> *"Here's our one-click interface. This is designed so anyone - from IT professionals to regular users - can securely wipe their devices."*

**Actions**:
1. **Double-click VeriWipe icon** on desktop
2. **Show the main interface** loading
3. **Point out the clean, simple design**

**Commentary**:
> *"Notice the user-friendly interface. No complex technical settings - our AI handles all the difficult decisions automatically."*

### **Phase 4: AI Device Detection** (2 minutes)

**You Say**:
> *"Watch our AI brain analyze the connected storage devices. It identifies each device type and selects the optimal wiping method."*

**Actions**:
1. **Click "Detect Devices" button**
2. **Wait for scanning** (10-15 seconds)
3. **Point to each device card** that appears
4. **Explain what the AI discovered**:

**Example Commentary**:
> *"See here - the AI identified three devices:*
> - *Main laptop SSD: 256GB Samsung - AI selected ATA Secure Erase*
> - *Test USB drive: 32GB Kingston - AI selected Multi-pass Overwrite*
> - *The AI knows that SSDs need hardware-level erasure, while USB drives need software overwriting. This intelligence prevents data recovery."*

### **Phase 5: Live Wipe Demonstration** (3-5 minutes)

**You Say**:
> *"I'll now demonstrate a real wipe on this test USB drive. This will permanently destroy all data - there's no going back."*

**Actions**:
1. **Select the test USB device**
2. **Click "Secure Wipe" button**
3. **Show the warning dialog**:

**Commentary for Warning**:
> *"Notice the multiple safety confirmations. We prevent accidental wipes with clear warnings and device verification."*

4. **Confirm the wipe**
5. **Show live progress updates**:

**Commentary During Wipe**:
> *"Watch the real-time progress. The AI is:*
> - *First: Unmounting the device safely*
> - *Second: Performing multi-pass overwrite (3 passes)*
> - *Third: Verifying the wipe was successful*
> - *Fourth: Generating tamper-proof logs*

> *This process follows NIST SP 800-88 government standards for data sanitization."*

### **Phase 6: Certificate Generation** (2 minutes)

**You Say**:
> *"Here's the game-changer - cryptographic proof that the wipe happened correctly."*

**Actions**:
1. **Show success message** with certificate files
2. **Open the PDF certificate**
3. **Highlight key sections**:
   - Device details
   - Wipe method used
   - Timestamp and verification
   - Digital signature
   - QR code

**Commentary**:
> *"This certificate is legally admissible proof of data destruction. The QR code allows instant verification, and the digital signature prevents tampering."*

### **Phase 7: Verification Demo** (1 minute)

**You Say**:
> *"Let me prove this certificate is authentic and verifiable."*

**Actions**:
1. **Take out smartphone**
2. **Scan QR code** on certificate
3. **Show verification website** loading
4. **Display verification results**

**Commentary**:
> *"The verification shows the certificate is authentic, unmodified, and the wipe operation is confirmed. This gives organizations complete confidence for compliance reporting."*

## 1. Executive Summary

VeriWipe is a **cross-platform, one-click AI-powered secure data-wiping solution** designed to build trust in IT asset recycling. It operates on **Windows, Linux, and Android**, securely erases all user data (including hidden areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors), and produces **tamper-proof, digitally signed certificates** in PDF and JSON formats. The system leverages AI for **adaptive wipe method selection, anomaly detection, and user guidance**, while remaining fully offline-first with optional blockchain anchoring for immutable verification. This approach promotes **safe e-waste disposal, circular economy, and user confidence**.

## 2. Problem Statement & Motivation

### Background
- India generates **1.75+ million tonnes of e-waste annually**; hoarding is due to fear of data breaches.  
- Existing tools are either **too complex, costly, or unverified**.  
- Over ₹50,000 crore worth of IT assets remain unused due to security concerns.

### Problem Statement
- Design a **secure, user-friendly, cross-platform data wiping tool**.  
- Features needed: **secure erase**, **tamper-proof certificates**, **offline operation**, and **third-party verification**.

## 4. Technical Approach

### Architecture
1. **Device Agent / Wipe Engine:** Platform-specific modules (Windows, Linux, Android).  
2. **Wipe Core:** Handles block-level commands, HPA/DCO, SSD crypto-erase, filesystem-aware secure delete.  
3. **Certificate Generator:** Generates PDF + JSON; digitally signed with ECDSA/Ed25519; includes QR code for verification.  
4. **Audit & Logs:** Tamper-evident, hash-chained logs; AI monitors for anomalies.  
5. **Blockchain Anchoring (Optional):** Stores certificate hashes for immutable verification.  
6. **AI Integration:**  
   - **Adaptive Method Selection:** ML model recommends wipe method.  
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Flags incomplete wipes or tampering.  
   - **NLP Assistant:** Explains process in English and local languages.  

### Device-Specific Erasure  
- **HDDs:** Multi-pass overwrite (`shred`/`dd`).  
- **SSDs / NVMe:** ATA/NVMe secure erase or crypto-erase.  
- **Hidden Areas:** HPA/DCO detection & wipe using `hdparm` commands.  
- **Android:** Factory reset + key deletion; unlocked devices use fastboot/ADB for block-level wipe.  
- **Windows:** BitLocker crypto-erase or WinPE offline block-level wipe.  

### Certificate & Verification  
- JSON manifest: Device metadata, method, timestamps, operation logs.  
- PDF: Human-friendly certificate with QR code linking to verification page.  
- Tamper-proof: Digital signature + chained logs; blockchain anchor optional.  
- Privacy-preserving: No raw personal data stored; hashed identifiers only.
